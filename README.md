Hey Y'all,
I'm a first semester graduate student in the geography department studying under Dr. Kelsey Ellis. While my thesis topic isn't set in stone, it looks like it may branch off of some of Dr. Ellis' research with hurricanes, which is fantastic.

I'm from southern Tennessee (Brentwood area specifically) and that will always be home to me, though I'm getting used to Knoxville. I'm actively involved in my church's college ministry, and I live in a house of 8 girls who are all also leaders in that ministry. Yes, we're all still friends even though we only have two bathrooms. Hallelujah.

When I have free time I love to read actual fiction books and not scholarly articles, train for half marathons, and plan for my wedding down the road (May of 2016!). 

Something memorable about me? I once saved my friend's life while white water rafting in Costa Rica. She bought me a jar of Nutella as a thank you, and I was never so delighted.
